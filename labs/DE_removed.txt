#### Printing the `dds` object *(Click to expand)*

We can also simply print the `dds` object, which will give a summary of its contents:

```{r}
dds
```

#### Histograms of gene counts *(Click to expand)*

To plot a histogram of mean gene counts across samples, we'll first create a data frame with these mean gene counts:

```{r}
mean_counts <- rowSums(count_mat) / ncol(count_mat)
mean_counts_df <- data.frame(mean_counts) |> 
  rownames_to_column("gene_id")
```

Now we can make the histogram:

```{r}
ggplot(mean_counts_df, aes(x = mean_counts)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  scale_y_log10() +
  theme_minimal()
```

Zoom in a bit:

```{r}
ggplot(mean_counts_df, aes(x = mean_counts)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  scale_y_log10() +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, 100000)) +
  theme_minimal()
```

Which genes have the highest mean counts, and what are those counts?

```{r}
sort(rowSums(count_mat) / ncol(count_mat), decreasing = TRUE)[1:10]
```
