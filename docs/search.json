(A sequencing facility typically does this for you.)\n\nLet’s consider different options you have for library prep:\n\n\nmRNA enrichment\nNeeded because mRNA makes up only a few percent of RNA molecules, and done using either:\n\nPolyA-selection: specifically selects mature (spliced) mRNAs\nRibodepletion: fishes out rRNA — this is suboptimal for mRNA-seq (presence of other RNAs and of pre-mRNAs) but can be a last resort with poor RNA quality\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLibrary strandedness\nLibraries can be “stranded” or “unstranded” —stranded libraries allow you to tell the directionality of a transcript, which in turn allows you to:\n\nDistinguish between overlapping genes\nAssess whether you may have DNA contamination"
