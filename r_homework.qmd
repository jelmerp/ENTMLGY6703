## R homework for the week 4 lab

If you have limited or no experience with R,
I would highly recommend that you go through part of the Data Carpentry
["Data Analysis and Visualisation in R for Ecologists" lesson](https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/index.html).

At least make your way through the [introductory page](https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/index.html) and the first
(["Before we start"](https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/00-before-we-start.html))
and second (["Introduction to R"](https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/01-intro-to-r.html)) lessons.

If you have time, then also go through:

- [Episode 3 (data frames)](https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/02-starting-with-data.html) --- until (not including) the ["Formatting dates" section](https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/02-starting-with-data.html#formatting-dates).
- [Episode 4 (tidyverse)](https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/03-dplyr.html) --- until (not including) the ["Split-apply-combine" section](https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/03-dplyr.html#split-apply-combine-data-analysis-and-the-summarize-function).
- [Episode 5 (ggplot)](https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/04-visualization-ggplot2.html) --- until (not including) the ["Arranging plots" section](https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/04-visualization-ggplot2.html#arranging-plots).

_You can do this homework either with your own R & RStudio installation_
_(the Carpentry lesson contains installation instructions),_
_or use RStudio at the Ohio Supercomputer Center (see the instructions below)._

4. Click the big blue **`Launch`** button at the bottom

5. Now, you should be sent to a new page with a box at the top for your RStudio
   Server "job", which should initially be "Queued" (waiting to start).

6. Your job should start running very soon,
   with the top bar of the box turning green and saying "Running".

7. Click **`Connect to RStudio Server`** at the bottom of the box,
   and an RStudio Server instance will open in a new browser tab.
   You're ready to go!

#### Having trouble installing the _tidyverse_ package?

If your using RStudio at OSC and your _tidyverse_ package installation fails,
please load this package as follows (no installation needed):

```{r, eval=FALSE}
custom_library <- "/fs/scratch/PAS2250/ENT6703/share/rlib"
library(withr, lib.loc = custom_library)
library(tidyr, lib.loc = custom_library)
library(tidyverse, lib.loc = custom_library)
```
