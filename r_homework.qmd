## R homework for the week 4 lab

If you have limited or no experience with R, I highly recommend that you go through part of the Data Carpentry ["Data Analysis and Visualisation in R for Ecologists" lesson](https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/index.html).

**At least** make your way through:

-   The [introductory page](https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/index.html)
-   [Episode 1 ("Before we start")](https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/00-before-we-start.html))
-   [Episode 2 ("Introduction to R")](https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/01-intro-to-r.html))

**If you have time**, then you can also go through:

-   [Episode 3 (data frames)](https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/02-starting-with-data.html) --- until (not including) the ["Formatting dates" section](https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/02-starting-with-data.html#formatting-dates).
-   [Episode 4 (tidyverse)](https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/03-dplyr.html) --- until (not including) the ["Split-apply-combine" section](https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/03-dplyr.html#split-apply-combine-data-analysis-and-the-summarize-function).
-   [Episode 5 (ggplot)](https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/04-visualization-ggplot2.html) --- until (not including) the ["Arranging plots" section](https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/04-visualization-ggplot2.html#arranging-plots).

*You can do this homework either with **your own R & RStudio installation** (the Carpentry lesson contains installation instructions), or use **RStudio at OSC** (see the instructions below).*

If you run into any issues when going through this material, or just have questions, don't hesitate to [email Jelmer](poelstra.1@osu.edu).

## Start an RStudio session at OSC

In case you want to use RStudio at the Ohio Supercomputer Center (OSC) for your homework, follow these instructions to get started:

1.  Log in to OSC at <https://ondemand.osc.edu>

2.  Click on **`Interactive Apps`** (top bar) and then **`RStudio Server`** (all the way at the bottom)

3.  Fill out the form as follows:

    -   Cluster: **`Pitzer`**
    -   R version: **`4.3.0`**
    -   Project: **`PAS2250`**
    -   Number of hours: **`4`**
    -   Node type: **`any`**
    -   Number of cores: **`2`**

</details>

4.  Click the big blue **`Launch`** button at the bottom

5.  Now, you should be sent to a new page with a box at the top for your RStudio Server "job", which should initially be "Queued" (waiting to start).

6.  Your job should start running very soon, with the top bar of the box turning green and saying "Running".

7.  Click **`Connect to RStudio Server`** at the bottom of the box, and an RStudio Server instance will open in a new browser tab. You're ready to go!

#### Having trouble installing the *tidyverse* package?

If you are using RStudio at OSC and the installation of the *tidyverse* package (or another package) with `install.packages()` fails, please load the packages that the Carpentries lesson uses as follows (no installation needed):

```{r, eval=FALSE}
custom_library <- "/fs/scratch/PAS2250/ENT6703/share/rlib"
.libPaths(custom_library)
library(tidyverse, lib.loc = custom_library)
library(hexbin, lib.loc = custom_library)
library(patchwork, lib.loc = custom_library)
library(RSQLite, lib.loc = custom_library)
```
