## Sanger sequencing

::: callout-note
#### **Amplification** of a target DNA fragment is usually done with PCR

-   This means that you need to (approximately) **know in advance short flanking sequences** to the sequence of interest â€” primers for your PCR.

-   **Introns** are good targets to sequence: variable sequences flanked by conserved sequences (exons) in which primers can be designed.

## RNA-seq projects

-   Effects of *Diplodia* pathogen exposure Austrian pine (*Pinus nigra*) over time.
-   Aphid biotypes & soybean cultivars under different flood conditions (Michel lab, Entomology)
